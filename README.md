Project Overview:
An analysis (topic modeling and sentiment analysis) of Disneyland reviews for 3 of its branches (California, Hong Kong, and Paris). Results were based on joint findings.
General Purpose:
Topic modeling can be used by Disney to automatically organize and categorize large collections of text data (in this case customer reviews). This makes it easier to analyze and understand the topics that are prevalent in customers’ feedback. Topic modeling can also be used to improve document search and retrieval efficiency within their internal review databases by identifying the main topics in a document and using those topics as keywords for search queries.
Sentiment analysis can be used to automatically classify and analyze the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of large volumes of text data, such as customer reviews, social media posts, and survey responses (independent of the “star” rating of the review).
Topic modeling can be used in conjunction with other natural language processing techniques, such as sentiment analysis, to gain deeper insights into customer opinions and preferences. For example, Disney could use topic modeling to identify the main topics of discussion in customer reviews, and then use sentiment analysis to determine the overall sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) associated with those topics.
Disney can use all of this information to prioritize areas for improvement in their products or services for each specific park location.
